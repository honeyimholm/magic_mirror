Augmented Reality "Magic Mirror"

This project tracks the users head position to overlay a halo when the user smiles. 

Because the screen is covered by a one way mirror, the user sees their reflection augmented with the new angelic decoration.

In this iteration we only enable the halo when the user smiles.
